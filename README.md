# Ambulance-Allocation-Optimization

This is a Java simulation program of the ambulance service to find the optimal distribution of
the ambulances across the regions that minimize the expected number of calls for which the 15-
minute response time is not met. In particular, randomly generate emergency calls, process/serve
the emergency calls and count the number of calls for which the 15-minute response time is not met. An ambulance service at a hospital has to cover a total of seven regions. Every region, which is hexagon shaped and fits precisely inside a circle with a diameter of 10 kilometer, has an ambulance
waiting dock placed at its center and the hospital is located in the middle region, thus the hospital is a waiting dock as well. In total, the ambulance server has 20 ambulances that need to be placed at the waiting docks.

The project is in Java
