# ðŸš‘ Ambulance Allocation Optimization


A Java simulation program that optimizes ambulance distribution across seven hexagonal regions to minimize emergency response times exceeding 15 minutes, with constraints of 20 available ambulances.


## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Geospatial Simulation**:
  - Seven hexagonal regions (10km diameter each)
  - Hospital at central region
  - Ambulance waiting docks at each center

- **Optimization Engine**:
  - Minimizes 15-minute response time failures
  - Dynamic ambulance allocation strategies
  - Emergency call event simulation

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Response time statistics
  - Coverage efficiency analysis
  - Resource utilization reports
